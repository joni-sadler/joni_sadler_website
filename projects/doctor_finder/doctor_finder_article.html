          to help people in Montreal find a family doctor and navigate the
          healthcare system. The goal was to create an interface where doctors
          and clinic administrators could enter their information and generate a
          public-facing profile that would allow them to share up-to-date,
          accurate information with the general public as part of a centralized
          system. The site also includes a map displaying clinics filtered by
          various criteria (those with doctors accepting new patients, allowing
          walk-ins, etc). Users can enter their postal code to display their
          location on the map and see which options are closest. While it was
          challenging to determine which clinics actually accepted different
          kinds of patients and appointments, I was able to create a basic
          mockup using fictional info. The clinics are all real places, but
          their permissions are not accurate and are simply meant to demonstrate
          various functionalities.

          One of my goals for this project was to maximize the app's efficiency.
          As a precaution against unnecessary API calls, I set up a caching
          system for repeat user postal code entries. An object called
          CACHED_POINTS contains a series of postal codes and their respective
          latitude/longitude coordinates, which allowed me to prime the cache
          with some sample data while integrating with the API.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot_container">
          <img
            src="cached_points.png"
            class="screenshot"
            alt="Project map screenshot"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          CACHED_POINTS also proved valuable for general use: when a person
          enters a new postal code, a useEffect is called that compares the
          entry with all data stored within the object. If the coordinates
          already exist, then its stored latitude and longitude are used. If
          not, a get request is made to the Open Maps API to retrieve the
          coordinates. That new data is assigned to originPoint using setState
          and the coordinates are added to the CACHED_POINTS object, where they
          will remain until the user refreshes their browser. This improved
          performance and served as an additional safety measure against
          redundant API calls.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot_container">
          <img
            src="doctor_finder_code.png"
            class="screenshot"
            alt="Code screenshot"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          By collecting and storing user input within the CACHED_POINTS object,
          we are able to reduce the number of API calls and increase the overall
          efficiency of the app. Since this site uses open source code and is
          not available for public use, these efficiency improvements are mostly
          theoretical; however, for calls to an API with strict limits (say,
          Google Maps and their Geolocation API) this can become a valuable way
          to reduce costs and streamline app functionality by minimizing API
          calls.
