          When I first set up this website I was making updates directly through
          my hosting service. Eventually I moved to an FTP app (FileZilla) to
          smooth out the process, and while this was a step in the right
          direction it still felt like there was room for improvement. A thought
          struck:
          <em
            >what if I could update my site automatically every time I push
            content to GitHub?</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The first step in implementing this was looking up
          <a
            href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ftp-deploy?fbclid=IwAR2N_8qbxe2r6aO-fC8NxDAlQxICy3y6Oa8-u0LwH-mYZmxLsdLtOwSDH5E"
            target="_blank"
            >FTP Deploy in GitHub Actions.</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the provided instructions, I created a .yml file in VS Code
          and added some preliminary info:
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot_container">
          <img
            src="GitHub_FTP_Deploy_Screenshot.png"
            class="screenshot"
            alt="GitHub FTP Deploy screenshot"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          The next step was to modify this original info with my username,
          server details, and password. I didn't want to store the password
          directly in the .yml file for security reasons.
          <a
            href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets"
            target="_blank"
            >GitHub secrets</a
          >
          to the rescue!
        </p>
        <p>
          To set up a GitHub secret, navigate to your project repository, go to
          'settings', and you will see 'secrets' in the menu displayed on the
          left side of your page:
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot_container">
          <img
            src="GitHub_Secrets_Screenshot.png"
            class="screenshot"
            alt="GitHub secrets screenshot"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          In 'secrets' you will see two options: Environment secrets and
          Repository secrets. At first I tried to set up an environment secret
          and use that for my password entry, but my preliminary deploy tests
          failed. My next course of action was going the repository secret
          route. That proved successful. To set up a repository secret, simply
          click the 'new repository secret' button, enter your information, and
          click the 'add secret' button to save. I opted to save my server name
          and username as secrets too for good measure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once my secrets were taken care of, I updated the .yml file with the
          new info.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot_container">
          <img
            src="github-actions.ylm_screenshot.png"
            class="screenshot"
            alt="Updated .yml file screenshot"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          After commiting my .yml file, I made a basic update to my website's
          homepage to ensure the deploy was being triggered whenever changes
          were pushed to the GitHub repo. The 'actions' tab on the GitHub repo
          is the best way to monitor this activity.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot_container">
          <img
            src="github_actions_screenshot.png"
            class="screenshot"
            alt="GitHub actions screenshot"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          A moment later, I was also able to see the new updates reflected
          directly on my website. This is a huge upgrade in terms of ease and
          efficiency. Definitely worth the initial effort!
