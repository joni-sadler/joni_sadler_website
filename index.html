              Joni Sadler passed away in her sleep—suddenly and without
              warning—of a brain aneurysm on May 30, 2021
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-center text-white-75">
              It pains us beyond words to announce this.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-white-75">
              It’s impossible to know how Joni would, or would not, have wanted
              to be remembered in death, because she was too busy living. What
              she would have wanted is to be alive. To grab a drink and see a
              show. To hug her friends. To tour Europe with her band Lungbutter,
              as she was set to do just before the pandemic. Without her, we can
              only believe she would want us to be together, to live life with
              purpose, and to be there for each other, like she was for us time
              and time and time again.
            </p>

            <p class="text-white-75">
              There’s no way to encapsulate the extent of Joni’s impact on our
              lives. She was grounded, focused, and intensely driven. Her quiet,
              thoughtful exterior belied the sheer force of will she harnessed
              to rally people with disparate interests around common goals – and
              to lift up the voices of independent musicians, in particular. Her
              fierce friendship and superhuman drive simply do not fit into the
              tiny box of words required in situations like this. For 35 years,
              she lived life to the fullest, and then some. She was not done
              yet.
            </p>

            <p class="text-white-75">
              The only child of entrepreneurs who loved road-tripping, Joni took
              up figure skating at a young age; she was a competitor bent on
              excellence and self-improvement. That drive soon found even more
              purpose in the music and DIY punk scene in her hometown of
              Victoria, British Columbia. At 18, she moved across the country to
              attend Carleton University in Ottawa, where she worked at indie
              record store Sounds Unlikely and as the English Music Director of
              CHUO 89.1 FM, the campus-community radio station at the University
              of Ottawa. She completed her BA in 2008 and MA in 2011, both in
              Communications; her Master’s thesis “Challenging Expectations:
              Perceptions Of Canadian Music and the Localized Practices of
              Experimental Artists” should be required reading for anyone
              interested in the importance of authentic and defiant
              do-it-yourself music scenes – an astute, accomplished work that
              has only gained relevance and salience in the decade since she
              wrote it. Joni then moved to Montreal to co-manage CKUT 90.3 FM at
              McGill University (from 2012 to 2017). She did a stint as POP
              Montreal’s Symposium Director (2017 and 2018) and became Director
              of Communications (though really, a position with more
              definitions, strands and responsibilities than can be encapsulated
              in any job title) at venerable independent record label
              Constellation (2017 to 2021).
            </p>

            <p class="text-white-75">
              COVID-19 has isolated us all. Joni approached the pandemic with
              immense caution, and would never begrudge anyone for needing to
              take care of themselves in the ways that make sense to them. She
              did the same. She missed her parents, friends, bandmates, and
              colleagues, but she also got immense satisfaction from working
              hard and pushing herself to do better. She didn’t do it for
              recognition, she did it on principle. During the pandemic, she
              threw herself into work on Constellation’s Corona Borealis series
              of releases to directly benefit artists and expanded the label’s
              indie platforms, while also learning to code JavaScript, React.js,
              Node.js, MongoDB, Express, HTML, CSS. Joni had just earned
              Concordia University’s Full Stack Web Development Diploma, and she
              was looking forward to the challenges these new skills would
              bring. Already, she was putting them to use in the redesign of the
              Constellation website and replacement of their web/email servers.
              Joni grabbed absolutely everything thrown her way – and dumped in
              her lap – and wrangled it.
            </p>

            <p class="text-white-75">
              Richard, her partner, is working with Joni's parents, Doug and
              Kathy, and her friends on memorial arrangements. Given the
              circumstances, and the ongoing pandemic, please respect the time
              required to take care of everything, safely and respectfully.
              Eventually, there will be larger public gatherings and memorial
              events, organised and announced when conditions permit.
