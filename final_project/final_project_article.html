      I recently built a little website designed to help people in Montreal find
      a family doctor and navigate the healthcare system. The goal was to create
      an interface where doctors and clinic administrators could enter their
      information and generate a public-facing profile that would allow them to
      share up-to-date, accurate information with the general public as part of
      a centralized system. The site would also include a map displaying clinics
      filtered by various criteria (those with doctors accepting new patients,
      allowing walk-ins, etc). Users could enter their postal code to display
      their location on the map and see which options are closest.

      For the maps component of this project, I initially opted to use Google
      Maps JavaScript API and Google Geocoding API. Things were going smoothly
      until I checked my billing account and noticed that I was on track to
      incur significant costs if I kept relying on these services. To avoid
      this, I removed both of these API keys, scrapped my existing code, and
      went back to the drawing board to develop a new plan.

      After some more research I settled on Open Street Map as my alternative.
      React Leaflet proved to be a useful tool in setting everything up. As an
      extra precaution against unnecessary API calls, I set up a caching system
      for repeat user postal code entries. An object called CACHED_POINTS
      contains a series of postal codes and their respective latitude/longitude
      coordinates, and I used these points for testing to ensure the
      functionality worked properly without making a new API call for each minor
      change. When a user enters a new postal code, a useEffect is called that
      compares the entry with all data stored within CACHED_POINTS. If the
      coordinates already exist within the object, then its stored latitude and
      longitude are used. If not, a get request is made to the Open Maps API to
      retrieve the coordinates. That new data is assigned to originPoint using
      setState and the coordinates are also added to CACHED_POINTS, where they
      will remain until the user refreshes their browser. This served as an
      additional safety measure against redundant API calls.
