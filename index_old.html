    <h3>
      It pains us beyond words to announce: Joni Sadler passed away in her
      sleep—suddenly and without warning—of a brain aneurysm on May 30, 2021.
    </h3>

    <p>
      The only child of entrepreneurs who loved road-tripping, Joni took up
      figure skating at a young age. She was a competitor bent on excellence and
      self-improvement. That drive soon found even more purpose in the music and
      DIY punk scene in her hometown of Victoria, British Columbia. At 18, she
      moved across the country to go to Carleton University in Ottawa, where she
      worked at a record store, called Sounds Unlikely, while also being the
      English Music Director of CHUO 89.1 FM, the campus-community radio station
      at the University of Ottawa. After completing her Bachelor’s in 2008, then
      Master’s in 2011, both in Communications, she moved to Montreal to
      co-manage CKUT 90.3 FM at McGill University (from 2012 to 2017). She did a
      stint as POP Montreal’s Symposium Director (2017 to 2018) and then took on
      the publicity and PR for the venerable indie record label, Constellation
      (2017 to 2021).

    <p>
      But there’s no way to encapsulate the extent of her impact on our lives,
      on the independent music industry, and on campus-community radio. She was
      grounded, focused, and intensely driven. Her quiet, thoughtful exterior
      belied the sheer force of will she harnessed to rally people with
      disparate interests around common goals, and lift up the voices of
      independent musicians, in particular. Her fierce friendship and superhuman
      drive simply do not fit into the tiny box of words required in situations
      like this. For 35 years, she lived life to the fullest, and then some. And
      she was not done yet.

    <p>
      COVID-19 has isolated us all. Joni approached the pandemic with immense
      caution, and would never begrudge anyone for needing to take care of
      themselves in the ways that make sense to them. She did the same. She
      missed her parents, friends, bandmates, and colleagues, but she also got
      immense satisfaction from working hard and pushing herself to do better.
      She didn’t do it for recognition, she did it on principle. During the
      pandemic, she threw herself into work on Constellation’s Corona Borealis
      series of releases to directly benefit artists, while also learning to
      code JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, HTML, CSS. Joni had
      just earned Concordia University’s Full Stack Web Development Diploma, and
      she was looking forward to the challenges these new skills would bring.
      Already, she had put them to use in the redesign of the Constellation
      website and replacement of their web/email servers.

    <p>
      It’s impossible to know how Joni would, or would not, have wanted to be
      remembered in death, because she was too busy living. What she would have
      wanted is to be alive. To grab a drink and see a show. To hug her friends.
      To tour Europe with her band Lungbutter, like she had planned to before
      the pandemic. Without her, we can only believe she would want us to be
      together, to live life with purpose, and to be there for each other, like
      she was for us, time and time and time again.
    </p>

      Richard, her partner of seven years, is working with Joni's parents, Doug
      and Kathy, on memorial arrangements. We are hoping to hold a gathering in
      Montreal, so Joni's parents can meet with some of the friends who so
      deeply cared for her. Given the circumstances, and the ongoing pandemic,
      please respect the time required to take care of everything, safely and
      respectfully. In the longer term, we hope there can be a larger, more
      public gathering, when time and circumstances allow.
